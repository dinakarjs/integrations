# AAIF authority comparison evidence runner

A shared evidence-appraisal runner and executable synthetic boundary fixtures for AAIF Identity & Trust [WG issue 13](https://github.com/aaif/wg-identity-and-trust/issues/13).

## Run

Python 3.12 and published `agentrust-trace==0.11.0` are supported for this contribution.

```sh
cd integrations/alakris-authority-comparison
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock
.venv/bin/python check_package.py --fetch
```

The single check command downloads pinned fixtures, runs the tests, writes author appraisals, verifies the corrected Proofable packet, preserves the historical Proofable hash failure, and validates TRACE reference shapes. To rerun individual stages:

```sh
.venv/bin/python fetch_fixtures.py --out fixtures
.venv/bin/python -m unittest -v
.venv/bin/python reference_adapter.py > results/synthetic-reference.json
.venv/bin/python runner.py mintid --evidence fixtures/mintid \
  --record revocation-trace-testnet-20261006T073712Z --output results/mintid-author-testnet.json
.venv/bin/python runner.py mintid --evidence fixtures/mintid \
  --record revocation-trace-local-20261005T094532Z --output results/mintid-author-local.json
.venv/bin/python runner.py proofable --evidence fixtures/proofable --output results/proofable-author-oct8.json
.venv/bin/python create_references.py --lock fixtures/download-lock.json --output results/trace-reference-shapes.json
```

The corrected Proofable command exits **0** only when the checksums, trace inventory and offline envelope appraisal pass. The separate historical packet at `fixtures/proofable-historical` still exits **1** for its published-byte checksum mismatch. `results/proofable-author.json` retains the failing digest and LF/CRLF diagnostic. Never update an expected publisher digest to make a run green.

`fetch_fixtures.py` downloads immutable source URLs and emits a download lock. Vendor evidence remains in its source repository; downloaded fixtures are not redistributed by this integration.

## Contract

This case-level appraisal complements [Sankalp's per-attempt comparison contract](https://github.com/probityai/agent-evidence-observer/blob/fb8cabc5c9c54459743497f2325bfef49b137a1a/interop/authority-unreachable-2026-10-03/CONTRACT.md). It does not replace native records, exact action/target identities, retained committed-effect evidence or terminal/recovery appraisal. Media bytes, destination and packaging need their own bindings; the original Alakris source snapshot is not a complete runnable provider deployment.

Four cases: binding veto; revoked authority with stale evidence and valid control; authority unavailable; revocation after dispatch. Each comparison keeps authority, decision, dispatch, committed effect, task outcome and receipt distinct. Evidence custody names the producer, artifact scope and appraiser separately. Each field has `state`, `value`, and `reason`:

- `measured`: the cited source has an observation; it can still be author-operated.
- `not_applicable`: this implementation/path has no equivalent.
- `not_emitted`: the public evidence does not expose the field.
- `not_measured`: the requested appraisal or measurement was not performed.

The evidence basis is separate (`author_record`, `synthetic_fixture`; actual native execution provenance is kept separately). A publisher's `SUPPORTED` result is retained as `publisher_claim`; it is not promoted to independent validation. Reference fixtures exercise a synthetic counter, not an Alakris production deployment or a completed matched scientific experiment.

MintID root epoch/height, root age, freshness limits, t0 definition, observed refusal and bound remain distinct. First-refusal observations are single-run measurements, not an end-to-end revocation SLA. Emergency bounds remain block-based and are never interpreted as a zero-second deadline. Original source revision, published evidence commit and live service build are separate pins. Old `public-v2026-10-05.5` outage evidence is not a result for the current `public-v2026-10-06.2` verifier. Refusal of a presentation does not establish that an external executor suppresses an effect. A post-dispatch accepted decision is not retroactively revoked by MintID; the relying party owns that boundary.

The synthetic executor rechecks expiry and revocation at commit, binds issued dispatch tokens to the action digest, refuses a veto, and deduplicates committed effects. Late recovery cannot reopen the original expired request. Its valid-control test must commit exactly once.

## TRACE bridge

`trace_references.behavior_reference()` uses released `agentrust-trace`'s `Reference.model_validate` with `rel: behavior-trace` and a raw-byte SHA-256 digest. It validates pointer shape only. No Trust Record or attestation is issued. A reference digest proves byte identity, not enforcement, effect, freshness or a signature. The contribution is an `external-evidence-source` and claims no TRACE conformance level.

The corrected Proofable Oct 8 packet discloses 11 portable envelopes. The adapter recomputes qHashes, recovers EIP-191 signers with DID/chain binding, and requires exact qHash-set equality across trace, manifest references and envelopes. This measures historical receipt integrity; current freshness remains unappraised. The unreachable case has no applicable receipt to verify. Revocation latency remains unmeasured and target-side effects lack an independent witness.

The verifier is vendored unchanged from the reviewed reader revision `2b54ee47491f0d1a86c7d9f47d434f8f02622043`; see `PORTABLE_ENVELOPE_NOTICE.txt` and its retained Apache-2.0 license. `fixtures/proofable` uses docs commit `9851059900e29ba701bb0f4df2bf89a2107f430c`. `fixtures/proofable-historical` preserves the earlier `3a45f026` packet, and `results/proofable-author.json` preserves its checksum FAIL. New results are written separately to `results/proofable-author-oct8.json`.

## Native implementation runs

Use the vendor's pinned release and official sandbox only, with synthetic identities. The MintID public command is:

```sh
uv run python test-harness/trace/revocation_trace.py \
  --target testnet --paths issuer,kill_switch,cascade --out <isolated-output-prefix>
```

This exercises presentation refusal, refresh and control paths; it does not execute a payment. Emergency credentials are operator-only and excluded. Unavailability requires an isolated local stack and is not independently reproduced by the public testnet run. Native results, exact revisions, commands and environment are recorded in `RESULTS.md`; an attempted or blocked run is not a pass.

## Review requests

- Chris: corrected public digests and offline envelopes are appraised for the Oct 8 packet. Independent live reproduction remains open; retain sanitized trace, author custody, unmeasured latency and absent target witness.
- Marc: rerun the disconnected-authority case on the current verifier; publish veto evidence and keep unavailable/protected-effect boundaries explicit.
- Sankalp and other reviewers: review field states and propose an observer adapter for actual committed effects.
- Imran: review runner/adapter placement and the pointer bridge. Maintainers set listing tier; no verification badge is requested before review/reproduction.

Further work: implementation-side dispatch/effect adapters, an independent observer, a matched same-input run, independent live reproduction, and the current-build outage run. This initial PR exposes those gaps rather than marking them complete.
